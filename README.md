# Weather Forecast App
Weather Forecast App using Javascript and Leaflet

# Features
•	Getting current weather for cities using OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api)

•	Showing a weather icon over each city (https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions)

•	While clicking this icon, the icon opens a popup has all current weather data 
- Humidity
- Pressure
- Temperature
- Wind Direction 
- Wind Speed 

•	Below the map, the slider has weather forecast for 1 week and when we slide, we can show the weather forecast for the selected day.

•	Warning I used OpenWeatherMap's One Call API for weather forecast. You can call the API once for each city.
